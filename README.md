As a data analyst for the global video game retailer Ice, your goal is to identify patterns that determine a game's success. By analyzing user and expert reviews, genres, platforms, sales data, and ESRB ratings, you aim to predict potential bestsellers and guide advertising strategies.

The dataset includes historical information up to December 2016, and your task is to use this data to forecast trends and plan campaigns for 2017. While the year is fictional, the focus is on developing data analysis skills to inform decision-making.

Analyzing factors like genre, platform, and age ratings that impact sales.
Identifying successful games to prioritize in marketing campaigns.
Gaining hands-on experience with data analysis techniques in a business context.
